# Executiables
In this directory, you will find the different sub-modules of FAFSA package:
- Component 0 is `{placeholder}`
- Component 1 is `{placeholder}`
- Component 2 is `{placeholder}`
- Component 3 has two options:
    - `HMMER_API.py` which queries a few amino acid sequeces from a user's database against PFAM and return an interpretable table
    - `compute_local_hmmer.py` upon downloading the pfam-A.hmm db locally, the user can query as much sequences their hardware allows to get HMMER/Pfam functional information
    - `compute_pair_function.py` this script is still in active development, but in the future, it should be able to parse the HMMER outputs, filter them and generate a dataframe if a protein pair are functional or not
- Component 4 is `{placeholder}`
- Component 5 is `{placeholder}`
- Component 6 is a proposed Spring quarter milestone


## Note
Currently these sub-modules/components aren't fully integrated into each other as the team faced many techincal hurdles that we weren't able to overcome in time
